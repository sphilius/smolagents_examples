# This import will likely require adjustments to smolagent_basic.py or PYTHONPATH
# For now, we'll assume it can be made to work.
# One common pattern is to put the core logic of smolagent_basic.py into a function.

# Example: If smolagent_basic.py was refactored to have a main_logic() function:
# from smolagent_basic import main_logic

class TestSmolAgentBasic(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch.dict(os.environ, {"HF_TOKEN": "test_hf_token"}, clear=True)
    @patch('smolagents.HfApiModel') # Mocking the class
    def test_agent_execution_success(self, MockHfApiModel):
        # Configure the mock model instance and its run method
        mock_model_instance = MockHfApiModel.return_value
        mock_model_instance.run.return_value = "The cube of 2 is 8."

        # Here, we would ideally call the main logic of smolagent_basic.py
        # For example, if it was refactored:
        # answer = main_logic("What is the cube of 2?")
        # self.assertEqual(answer, "The cube of 2 is 8.")

        # As smolagent_basic.py currently runs on import and prints,
        # we might need to use subprocess or further refactor it.
        # For now, this test structure shows the intent.
        print("Placeholder for smolagent_basic.py execution test")
        self.assertTrue(True) # Placeholder assertion

    @patch.dict(os.environ, {"HF_TOKEN": "test_hf_token"}, clear=True)
    @patch('smolagents.HfApiModel')
    def test_agent_model_initialization(self, MockHfApiModel):
        # Test if the agent initializes the HfApiModel correctly

        # To test this, smolagent_basic.py would need to be imported or its relevant code executed.
        # We'd then assert that HfApiModel was called with expected parameters.
        # Example (if agent instantiation was in a function):
        # initialize_agent()
        # MockHfApiModel.assert_called_once_with(model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
        print("Placeholder for model initialization test")
        self.assertTrue(True) # Placeholder assertion
